# Introduction

***

## Introduction to the problem

As prefaced earlier, the Geographically Weighted Regression model in PySAL can currently estimate Gaussian, Poisson and Logistic models though the Multiscale extension of the GWR model is currently limited to only Gaussian models. This part of the project aims to expand the MGWR model to nonlinear local spatial regression modeling techniques where the response outcomes may be binomial (or a Logit model). This will enable a richer and holistic local statistical modeling framework to model multi-scale process heterogeneity for the open source community.

## Statistical Equations

***

A conventional Logistic regression model with $x_1, x_2, ... ,x_k$ as predictors, a binary(Bernoulli) response variable y and l denoting the log-odds of the event that y=1, can be written as:

\begin{align}
l = log_b ( p / (1-p)) = ({\sum} {\beta} & _k x _{k,i}) \\
\end{align}

where  $x_{k,1}$ is the kth explanatory variable in place i, $ùõΩ_{ks}$ are the parameters and p is the probability such that p = P( Y = 1 ).

By exponentiating the log-odds:

$p / (1-p) = b^ {ùõΩ_0+ùõΩ_1 x_1+ùõΩ_2 x_2} $

It follows from this - the probability that Y = 1 is:

$p = (b^ {ùõΩ_0 + ùõΩ_1 x_1 + ùõΩ_2 x_2}) / (b^ {ùõΩ_0 + ùõΩ_1 x_1 + ùõΩ_2 x_2} + 1)$ = $1 / (1 + b^ {-ùõΩ_0 + ùõΩ_1 x_1 + ùõΩ_2 x_2})$


# Local Scoring Algorithm

***

Following the technique from (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1986), for logisitic generalized additive models the model was estimated using the local scoring algorithm as follows:

1. Initialize the current estimate of the additive predictor $n_i^{old}$:<br>$n_i^{old} = {\sum} {\beta}_k  X_k$<br>and the probability such P(Y=1): $p_i^{old} = exp({n_i^{old}})/(1+exp({n_i^{old}}))$ <br><br>
2. Compute the working response: <br>
$z_i = n_i^{old} + (y_i - p_i^{old})/(p_i^{old}(1-p_i^{old}))$<br><br>
3. compute weights $w_i = p_i^{old} (1-p_i^{old})$<br><br>
4. obtain $n_i^{new}$ by fitting a weighted additive model to $z_i$. In this the smoothers in the backfitting algorithm incorporate the additional weights and GWR is used for the linear parts.<br><br>

These steps are repeated until the relative change in the fitted coefficients and the functions is below a tolerance threshold (1e-05 in this case).

### Further work required:

The parameters for the estimated model using Monte Carlo tests with simulated data are close to expected. Further exploration is required to theoretically justify the model in the context of spatial data models, especially MGWR.

As an exploration, this work includes results from both adding a stochastic error to the model during calibration and without it. Results for both are shown in the notebooks below.
